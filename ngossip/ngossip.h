	A parasite number is one that retains the exact same digits when multiplied or divided by
	another number. For example 102,564 x 4 = 410,256 arrived at by merely moving the last 4 to the
	beginning of the remaining 5 digits. Similarly, 179,487 x 4 = 717,948. You might say that the
	digits are parasitic after being operated on.

	A cyclic number is a number of "n" digits that when multiplied by 1, 2, 3,...n, results in the
	same digits but in a different order. For example, the number 142,857 is a cyclic number since
	142,857 x 2 = 285,714, 142,857 x 3 = 428,571, 142,857 x 4 = 571,428, and so on. It is not known
	just how many cyclic numbers exist.
